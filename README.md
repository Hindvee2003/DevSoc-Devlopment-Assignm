Website for Eateries in Kgp
I could make the cover page for the website. It had a fixed navbar, nice cover image, and list of eateries in IIT Kgp campus, which are categoried into four categories.
Each Eatery will has a clickable link which will redirect it separate webpage for each of them. I have it only for Smartpind. Similarly will be made for each eatery.

I am still learning backend, and was not able to implement it in the given deadline. I regret for the same.
